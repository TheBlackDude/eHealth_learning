                      <p class="blurb">Lectures are generally five days per week, and are intended to intermediate Techies. Each lecture covers a particular aspect of a technology or its ecosystem. Lectures build on each other - that is, the material gets progressively more advanced throughout the quarter. Slides are heavily animated, so both the compressed and full versions of the slide decks are uploaded.</p>
                      <p class="blurb">Unfortunately, the Academy does not record full videos, but nevertheless the videos provided are from the experts. Our goal is that the videos are a helpful learning resource, and hopefully they improve the tech experience for you!</p>
