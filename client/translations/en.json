Lectures build on each other - that is, the material gets progressively more advanced throughout the quarter. Slides are heavily animated, so both the compressed and full versions of the slide decks are uploaded.\n Unfortunately, the Academy does not record full videos, but nevertheless the videos provided are from the experts. Our goal is that the videos are a helpful learning resource, and hopefully they improve the tech experience for you!",

Although students work on these projects in three days period, it would take much longer to fully complete a good project. Each project comes with a number of challenge problems that will take even the experiences programmer nontrivial time. projects are collaborative and open-source, Basicaly Helping you to think about how or why The Technologies we use as Tech Professionals makes their decisions. Each project is chosen by it's team to reinforce a particular concept, and you are encouraged to check them out. You are not expected to submit your project, although it will be good if you do. Think of projects as a chance to solidify your working knowledge of the Topics Covered - after all, what better way to learn Something than to practice it?",
