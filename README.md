eHealth_learning is an Application that give people access to the content Covered at the eHealth-Academy in Guinea and give them access to other Advanced Topics in the Tech industry.

The Application is Based on Django, Djangorestframework and Angularjs

if you want to see how it's was built!

1. Clone the repo: git clone (the repo url)

2. cd into it and type pip3 install -r requirements.txt if you have python installed

3. next cd into client and type bower install angularjs angular-route bootstrap

4. go back in the root folder where you see the README.md file

5. type python3 server/manage.py makemigrations if no errors type python3 server/manage.py migrate

6. then start the development server: python3 server/manage.py runserver

7. Open up your bowser and goto: localhost:8000 if no errors everything should work

One more thing: all the Django Stuff is in the server folder and all the Angularjs Stuff is in the client folder

Thank You
